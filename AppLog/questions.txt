# How do you handle multiple users inside the app with firebase channels?
  Say im am logging with two users on the same device that means that i will now forever receive pushes for those two users.
  I am guessing that i missed something when cloning your code.

# After a user delete a thread he wont get any more messages from this thread,
  So if the other user want to message him again he would have to delete his and start a new one. Is this OK or im doing it wrong?

# Where to place in the list (Top/Bottom) threads that has no messages but the user is the creator?
