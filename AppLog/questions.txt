# Authenticating with firebase could take a few seconds so what should be the interval between checks.
  Let say the user or the system killed the app and now the user
  got a push message after 10Min should i re-auth ?

# How do you handle multiple users inside the app with firebase channels?
  Say im am logging with two users on the same device that means that i will now forever receive pushes for those two users.
  I am guessing that i missed something when cloning your code.

# After a user delete a thread he wont get any more messages from this thread,
  So if the other user want to message him again he would have to delete his and start a new one. Is this OK or im doing it wrong?

# We need to work on making our resources the same, i.e longitude and latitude values, Color Values and Date Values.
