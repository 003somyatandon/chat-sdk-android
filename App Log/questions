# When the user send an image message do you show him a dialog so he would know when the message is uploaded?

# What are you showing to the user while the app is downloading the message image from the server.

# Have you considered inserting the user details(name, font, metadata etc...) to a "folder" like the thread details?
  Currently when i add a thread to a user the details are changed and the app is loading all his data again. Its not that bad but seems wasteful.

# How do you handle multiple users inside the app with firebase channels?
  Say im am logging with two users on the same device that means that i will now forever receive pushes for those two users.
  I am guessing that i missed something when cloning your code.

# After a user delete a thread he wont get any more messages from this thread,
  So if the other user want to message him again he would have to delete his and start a new one. Is this OK or im doing it wrong?

# We need to work on making our resources the same, i.e longitude and latitude values, Color Values and Date Values.

# What is your app twitter client id and all relevant data so i could add the twitter log in.

# What is the max length in characters for a message?

# Can anonymous user open a private chat with another user?
